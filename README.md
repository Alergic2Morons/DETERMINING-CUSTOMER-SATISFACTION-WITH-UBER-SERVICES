## Projects
### Evaluating Customer Satisfaction With Uber Services
[Work]()

Data scraped from Trustpilot was used to perform sentiment analysis with Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to classify reviews into positive, negative, and neutral sentiments. Further analysis of word frequency helped identify common themes and issues. The results were visualized using interactive dashboards in Tableau, highlighting key insights such as geographical variations in customer satisfaction and peak review times. The analysis revealed significant dissatisfaction among customers, prompting recommendations for Uber to enhance driver education and service quality.

### Decoding Physical and Cognitive Impacts of Particulate Matter Concentrations at Ultra-Fine Scales
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/11/4240)

Used **Matlab** to train over 100 machine learning models which estimated particulate matter concentrations based on a suite of over 300 biometric variables. We found biometric variables can be used to accurately estimate particulate matter concentrations at ultra-fine spatial scales with high fidelity (r2 = 0.91) and that smaller particles are better estimated than larger ones. Inferring environmental conditions solely from biometric measurements allows us to disentangle key interactions between the environment and the body.
